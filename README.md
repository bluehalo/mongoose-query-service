## Use
`@asymmetrik/mongoose-query-service` provides utility services for creating and executing Mongoose queries based on a simple input search object. Additionally, it provides several plugins (`pageable` and `gettable`) that can be applied to Mongoose Schemas to allow them to add functionality to those Mongoose Schemas.

## Install

Include this module as a dependency of your application in the `package.json` file. For example:
```
{
  ...
  dependencies: {
    "@asymmetrik/mongoose-query-service": "latest"
  }
  ...
}
```

## Usage

Include the module via `require` wherever applicable:
```
var mongooseQueryService = require('@asymmetrik/mongoose-query-service');
```

### Plugins

Apply any of the plugins to a Mongoose model using the `.plugin(...)` method provided by Mongoose. For example:
```
var Person = new Schema({});
Person.plugin(mongooseQueryService.plugins.pageable);
```

### Services

Service methods are available from the base `@asymmetrik/mongoose-query-service` module, and can be called directly with the parameters defined in the API below.

## API

### Plugins

The following plugins are available at the top level `plugins` attribute:

#### pageable

Applying the `pageable` plugin at `mongooseQueryService.plugins.pageable` adds a static method to Mongoose model called `pagingSearch` that takes an input object parameter with the following attributes:

Attribute | Optional? | Default | Description
------------ | ------------- | ------------ | -------------
query | Yes | `{}` | Filters to pass to the Mongo query
projection | Yes | `{}` | Attributes to return in the elements
options | Yes | `{}` | Query options specified by Mongoose
searchTerms | Yes | null | String of search terms that will be translated into a search on the text index for the model
populate | Yes | null | Populate options specified by Mongoose
sorting | Yes | {} | Attributes for sorting and directions of each sort. Defaults to descending sort. Accepts either an object with a standard Mongo sorting config or an array of objects with `property` and `direction` attributes that will be translated into the standard Mongo sorting config.
page | Yes | 0 | To support paged searches, combines with `limit` to set the `skip` attribute of the Mongo query. If `limit` is not provided, `page` is not used.
limit | Yes | null | If provided, returns up to this number of results. Combines with the `page` parameter when setting the `skip` attribute of the Mongo query

The `pagingSearch` method returns a Promise resolved with an object with the following attributes:

Attribute | Type | Description
------------ | ------------- | ------------
hasMore | Boolean | Indicates if more documents are available if the next page of results is queried
totalSize | Number | The total count of documents that passed the query filter
pageNumber | Number | The current page of results returned. `0` if not paging
pageSize | Number | The current size of each page returned. Set to the input `limit` value (if provided) or the actual size
totalPages | Number | The number of pages from the the total size and page size configuration
elements | Array | The results that were found matching the current page.

*Example:*
```
var Person = new Schema({});
Person.plugin(mongooseQuerySchema.plugins.pageable);
```

#### gettable

Applying the `gettable` plugin at `mongooseQueryService.plugins.gettable` sets the `toObject` and `toJSON` attributes of the Mongoose Schema to `{ getters: true }` so that any `get` method defined in a Schema Type is used when the `toObject` or `toJSON` methods are invoked on the Mongoose model.

*Example:*
```
var Person = new Schema({});
Person.plugin(mongooseQuerySchema.plugins.gettable);
```

### Services

#### buildQuery(query, pagingParameters)

Converts input query and paging parameters into a pageable query object to be used with the `pageable` plugin's `pagingSearch` function.

Returns a promise resolved with the resulting search config object with the attributes:

Attribute | Type | Description
------------ | ------------- | ------------
query | Boolean | Indicates if more documents are available if the next page of results is queried
sorting | Object | If a `sort` attribute of `pagingParameters` is set, builds a sorting object with a direction set by the `dir` attribute (defaulting to -1 for descending, or set by 'DESC' or 'ASC').
page | Number | Set by the input `page` attribute of `pagingParameters` passed into the `getPage` method
limit | Number | Set by the input `size` attribute of `pagingParameters` passed into the `getLimit` method

#### validateNonEmpty
Returns true of the input value is not empty (using the lodash *isEmpty* function)

#### parseDate
Parse an input as a date. Handles various types of inputs, such as Strings, Date objects, and Numbers.

@param {date} The input representing a date / timestamp

@returns The timestamp in milliseconds since the Unix epoch

#### getLimit
Get the limit provided by the input query parameters, if there is one. Limit is taken from the `size` attribute of the input `queryParams` object. Limit has to be at least 1 with a default value of 20 and no more than the max value.

@param queryParams

@param maxSize (optional) default: 100

@returns {number}

#### getPage
Page needs to be positive and has no upper bound. Taken from the `page` attribute of the input `queryParams` object. Defaults to 0.

@param queryParams

@returns {number}

#### contains
Determine if an array contains a given element by doing a deep comparison.

@param arr

@param element

@returns {boolean} True if the array contains the given element, false otherwise.

#### toMongoose
Converts an input Mongo query, possibly with $date and $obj attributes, to a query that Mongoose supports with Date and ObjectId objects mapped from those inputs as appropriate.

@param obj

@returns {object}
